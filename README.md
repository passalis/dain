# Deep Adaptive Input Normalization for Time Series Forecasting


Deep Learning (DL) models can be used to tackle time series analysis tasks with great success. However, the performance of DL models can degenerate rapidly if the data are not appropriately normalized. This issue is even more apparent when
DL is used for financial time series forecasting tasks, where the non-stationary and multimodal nature of the data pose significant challenges and severely affect the performance of DL models. Deep Adaptive Input Normalization (DAIN) is a simple, yet effective, neural layer, that is capable of adaptively normalizing the input time series, while taking into
account the distribution of the data. DAIN is trained in an end-to-end fashion using back-propagation and can lead to significant performance improvements.


In this repository we provide an implementation of the [Deep Adaptive Input Normalization (DAIN)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.07892.pdf) using PyTorch. Sample data loaders to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method using a large-scale limit order book dataset (FI-2010 dataset) are also provided. 

### Howto run:

We provide an example of using the proposed method in `run_exp.py` and we compare DAIN to other normalization approaches. The proposed method can both increase the price forecasting as shown below (evaluation on all splits using a two layer MLP, prediction horizon = 10, window = 15):


| Method         | F1 score  | Cohen's kappa | 
| -------------  | --------- | ------------- |  
| z-score        |   0.550   |     0.327     | 
| Sample Avg.    |   0.434   |     0.205     | 
| DAIN (full)    |   0.682   |     0.514     | 

 - 1. Please download the preprocessed data from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vvvqwfejyertr4q/lob.tar.xz?dl=0). The dataset was based on the [FI-2010 dataset](https://etsin.avointiede.fi/dataset/urn-nbn-fi-csc-kata20170601153214969115).
 - 2. extract the file (`tar xvf log.tar.gz`) and place it in the cloned repo dir.
 - 3. setup env, you can use predefined `conda env create -f environment.yml`
 - 4. run the examples and reproduce the results: `python run_exp.py`
